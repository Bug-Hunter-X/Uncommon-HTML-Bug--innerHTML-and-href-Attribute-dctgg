This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to using innerHTML in HTML.  The bug arises from insecurely inserting content with HTML tags and an href attribute. The bug.html file contains the erroneous code, while bugSolution.html provides a safer alternative. The solution uses DOM manipulation instead of directly modifying innerHTML to avoid potential vulnerabilities.  Improper use of innerHTML can create XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerabilities, which is why a safer method is highly recommended.
